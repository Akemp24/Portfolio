                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a graduate of Western Carolina University Class of 2019.
                    I received my degree in Forensic Science with a concentration in Chemistry however, after working in the field for a couple of years I decided I wanted a new Path.
                    I am currently in a Full Stack Development Program set to end in October of 2023. So far the skills we have learned are HTML, and CSS but, I am excited to see where the rest of this course takes me.

                <p>As of April 2023 I currently do not have many projects to link yet. I have listed the first challenge of our bootcamp.
                    Stay Tuned.
